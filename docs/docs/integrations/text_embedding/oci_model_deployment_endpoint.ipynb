    "After having deployed model, you have to set up **`endpoint`**: The model HTTP endpoint from the deployed model, e.g. `\"https://modeldeployment.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/<MD_OCID>/predict\"` of the `OCIModelDeploymentEndpointEmbeddings` call\n",

Check out [here](https://accelerated-data-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/cli/authentication.html) to see more options. \n",
